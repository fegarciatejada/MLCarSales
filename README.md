# Predict Car Purchasing Dollar Amount using ANNs

## Project Overview

This project leverages Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to predict the total dollar amount customers are willing to pay for cars. By evaluating customer attributes, this model aids car salesmen in customizing their sales approach and better understanding potential sales dynamics.

### Attributes analyzed:
- **Customer Name**
- **Customer E-mail**
- **Country**
- **Gender**
- **Age**
- **Annual Salary**
- **Credit Card Debt**
- **Net Worth**

**Target Variable:** Car Purchase Amount

## Technologies Used

This project is implemented in **Python 3.x**, utilizing the following libraries:
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: For making statistical graphics.
- **TensorFlow**: Assumed for building and training the ANN model (though not listed in the initial libraries, it's crucial for ANN projects).
