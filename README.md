## Predict Car Purchasing Dollar Amount using ANNs

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a predictive model using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to estimate the total dollar amount customers are willing to pay for cars. By analyzing various customer attributes, this model helps car salesmen tailor their offerings and understand potential sales better. The attributes considered include:

Customer Name
Customer E-mail
Country
Gender
Age
Annual Salary
Credit Card Debt
Net Worth
The target variable for our model is the Car Purchase Amount.
